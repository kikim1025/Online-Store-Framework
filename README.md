# Online-Store-Framework
A full stack app to implement an online store system

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack project that uses Node.js, Express, and MySQL to deploy a server that host a product shop.
The website will show products, and users can look at each products to buy, which will then update the MySQL database.

Current implementation is very very bad, because new product transaction is calculated on front end. This need to be updated to backend calc later when I have time.

## Project Usage
The project website will show a main page, with a show product button. User can enter quantity to buy on each product and hit buy button to purchase.
